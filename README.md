# `nlopes/slack` has moved!

It is being actively maintained at [slack-go/slack](https://github.com/slack-go/slack).

This fork was created when the project was moved, and is provided
for backwards compatibility for old projects, but no guarantees are
made on how up to date it will be.

You're encouraged to update your import statements to use the official `slack-go/slack`
version above.

Apologies for the fuss, the new place has amazing people maintaining the community alive.
